# STS-BSC Manager — Claude Code Instructions

## What This App Is
Web app for managing Secondary Traumatic Stress Breakthrough Series Collaboratives. Built for CTAC (Center on Trauma and Children) at the University of Kentucky. Collects assessments from frontline workers, provides dashboards/reports for team leaders, and admin tools for CTAC staff.

> **See [`INFRASTRUCTURE.md`](INFRASTRUCTURE.md)** for the live production stack — domains, DNS, email pipeline, hosting, and operational gotchas. Update that doc when infrastructure changes.
>
> **See [`WORKING_NOTES.md`](WORKING_NOTES.md)** for a running log of recently shipped features (so you don't have to re-read git log) and a drafts section where Josh + Claude Code can hand off prompts to Claude.ai for implementation. Append-only — read it on session start, append to it as features ship or ideas crystallize.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 19 + Vite, inline styles (no CSS framework), Recharts for charts
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + Edge Functions)
- **Hosting:** Vercel (auto-deploys from `main` branch), root dir = `frontend`
- **Routing:** React Router v7
- **Export:** jspdf + xlsx for PDF/Excel reports

## Brand Colors
- Navy: `#0E1F56` (headers, primary)
- Teal: `#00A79D` (accents, buttons)
- Use `COLORS` object from `frontend/src/utils/constants.js`

## Key Conventions
- Inline styles everywhere — no CSS modules, no Tailwind
- Shared styles: `cardStyle`, `cardHeaderStyle` from `constants.js`
- Modals follow the pattern in `AddTeamModal.jsx` (overlay + stopPropagation)
- Data fetching: `useState` + `useEffect` + `supabase.from().select()` — no realtime subscriptions
- Role checks via `useAuth()` which exposes `isSuperAdmin`, `isAgencyAdmin`, `isTeamMember`, `user`, `profile`
- All pages use `maxWidth: 1200px` with `margin: '0 auto'` for consistent centering
- `index.css` has been cleaned up from Vite defaults — no flex/place-items on body

## Roles
- `super_admin` — CTAC director-level (Josh, Ginny). God mode: sees every collaborative, every team, every assessment. Lands on AdminDashboard.
- `trainer_admin` — CTAC trainer/faculty. Admin-tier access scoped to the collaboratives they're listed on in `collaborative_trainers`. Lands on AdminDashboard but only sees their assigned collabs and their teams' data; cross-collab tools (Strategy Ideas, Change Framework, Staff Directory, STS-PAT Overview, Self-Rating Engagement, Unmatched Attendees) are hidden. Cannot create new collaboratives or modify trainer assignments — only super_admins can.
- `agency_admin` — Team leaders, sees TeamDashboard, scoped to their team, can invite team members
- `team_leader` — Same access as agency_admin (legacy name)
- `team_member` — Read-only dashboard access + resources + forum participation. Cannot edit SMARTIE goals, checklists, or team settings.

### Role helpers
- DB: `is_super_admin()` and `is_admin_for_collaborative(uuid)` — both `SECURITY DEFINER`. Use the latter in RLS policies that gate per-collab data; it returns true for super_admins (regardless of arg) and for trainer_admins on the given collab. There is also `user_admin_collaborative_ids()` which returns `setof uuid` of the caller's assigned collabs.
- Frontend: `useAuth()` exposes `isSuperAdmin`, `isTrainerAdmin`, `isAdminLevel` (either), `myAdminCollaborativeIds`, and `canAdminCollaborative(collabId)`. Use `canAdminCollaborative` anywhere a page is scoped to a single collab.

## User Invitation Flow
- **Edge Function:** `invite-team-leader` (generalized — handles all role invites)
  - Accepts `role` param (`agency_admin`, `team_leader`, `team_member`)
  - Accepts `agency_role`, `is_senior_leader`, `resend` params
  - Agency admins can invite to their own team; super admins can invite to any team
  - On `resend: true`, deletes existing user and re-invites with fresh token
- **Email flow:** Supabase `inviteUserByEmail()` → user clicks link → `AuthRedirectHandler` catches `type=invite` hash → redirects to `/set-password` → user sets password → redirects to `/admin`
- **Redirect URL:** Hardcoded to `https://bsc.ctac.app/set-password`
- **Rate limits:** Custom SMTP via Resend is configured (see `INFRASTRUCTURE.md`). Auth email rate limit raised from 2/h to 30/h. If hitting that ceiling, raise it in Supabase Auth → Rate Limits.

## Database Gotchas
- **Assessment query pattern:** Always join through `assessment_responses`. Never query `demographics`/`stss_responses`/etc. by `team_code_id` directly — they link via `assessment_response_id`.
- **RLS helper functions:** `is_super_admin()`, `user_collaborative_id()`, and `user_team_id()` are `SECURITY DEFINER` functions that bypass RLS to avoid recursion.
- **Teams RLS:** Uses `is_super_admin() OR id = user_team_id()` — works for all roles with a team.
- **user_profiles RLS:** Users can read own profile + profiles from own team (via `user_team_id()`). Super admins can read all.
- **Role constraint:** `user_profiles_role_check` CHECK allows: `super_admin`, `trainer_admin`, `agency_admin`, `team_leader`, `senior_leader`, `team_member`
- **Gender values:** 'M', 'F', 'NB', 'not_listed' — NOT 'male'/'female'
- **STSI-OA columns:** Use `item_1` through `item_37` format (not `item_1a`)
- **Resources domains:** Stored as `TEXT[]` array, e.g. `{'resilience','safety'}`
- **Forum threads:** Scoped per collaborative via `collaborative_id` FK
- **user_profiles columns:** `id`, `email`, `full_name`, `role`, `team_id`, `is_active`, `agency_role`, `is_senior_leader`, `invite_accepted_at`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **collaborative_trainers** join table for who's a trainer/coordinator on a collaborative. Columns: `id`, `collaborative_id`, `user_id`, `is_coordinator`. Unique partial index `WHERE is_coordinator = true` enforces one coordinator per collab. Source of truth for the Trainer Dashboard.
- **`pg_cron` is enabled.** Three scheduled jobs:
  - `close-expired-sessions` — every minute; deactivates session_links 30 min after event end_time and bulk-stamps `session_attendance.signed_out_at` for stragglers. Sessions without `end_time` never auto-close.
  - `day-before-reminders` — daily at 13:30 UTC (~9:30 AM ET in summer); calls `fire_day_before_reminders()` which finds events 1 day out and posts to the `send-event-reminder` edge function via `pg_net`.
  - `week-before-reminders` — daily at 15:00 UTC (~11:00 AM ET in summer); same pattern, 7 days out.
  Both reminder crons require `vault.secrets` row named `service_role_key` (one-time manual setup; documented in INFRASTRUCTURE.md). Without it, they no-op silently.
- **`event_rsvps`, `event_reminder_log`, `event_parking_lot_items`, `smartie_goal_comments`** — auxiliary tables for the May 8 feature batch (RSVP buttons in reminder emails, idempotent reminder dispatch, per-event off-topic tracker, trainer feedback on goals). All RLS-scoped via `is_admin_for_collaborative` except `event_rsvps`, which has public SELECT/UPDATE policies so anonymous email recipients can flip their status by `rsvp_token`.
- **`user_profiles.unsubscribe_token` / `notifications_unsubscribed_at`** — every user gets a stable hex token (16 bytes); the `/unsubscribe/:token` public page sets `notifications_unsubscribed_at` and the reminder/email edge functions skip those users.
